    <h3> Participation Day</h3>

    <p>Participation Day is the main house event of the year. It takes place on the first Friday of every year where every house dresses up in a theme related to its color. Then the houses do a march with a song and dance routine followed up by chants. Then the houses split up and do a range of sporting activities for points for the rest of the day. This is a great house activity to start the year with. </p>

    <h3>Haka Waiata</h3>

    <p>The Haka Waiata competition is my personal favourite house comeptition. This is the second most important house contest after participation day and is often the most highly contested one. What happens is every house does their own take on the school haka and waiata being marked and the best performance wins the competition. This year Fox house won the Haka Waiate competition. </p>

The councils plan and run events around the school such as mufti days and house basketball and dodgeball.
